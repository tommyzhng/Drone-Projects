# drone
This repository contains code and videos of my drone development progress.

The current two projects I have coded as of Dec 1st 2022:
- Person tracking / following drone
- Hoverslam Drone (Innapplicable to real life due to physical limitations like vortex ring state)



The code is tested using arducopter's SITL along with the Gazebo simulator. This reduces error and chance of failure in real life.
